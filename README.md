# Tree_Interview_Question

This repository contains solutions to various tree-related interview questions implemented in Java. Each file addresses a specific problem related to binary trees and binary search trees (BSTs). Here's a brief overview of the files:

- **Ancestors_in_BT.java**: Find ancestors of a given node in a binary tree.
- **BST_FromPreOrder.java**: Construct a BST from a given preorder traversal sequence.
- **CheckSubTree.java**: Check if one binary tree is a subtree of another.
- **InOrder.java, PostOrder.java, PreOrder.java**: Implementations of in-order, post-order, and pre-order traversals of a binary tree.
- **MaximumSumof_Non_adjacent_nodes.java**: Find the maximum sum of non-adjacent nodes in a binary tree.
- **PreorderToBST.java**: Convert a given preorder traversal of a BST into the BST.
- **RootToLeafPathSum.java**: Find paths in a binary tree that sum up to a given value.
- **Search_inBST.java**: Search for a node in a binary search tree.

These solutions are designed to demonstrate efficient handling of common tree operations and are useful for preparing for technical interviews focusing on data structures and algorithms.
